# tensorflow-notebooks

This is essentially a clone of docs from the main tensorflow.org site 
which have been converted into jupyter notebooks.

Wherever possible, the notebook exactly follows the original tensoflow
documentation, however in some cases this is not exactly possible.

It is meant for this to be a more alive form of the documentation in which
the reader can try out things and experiment as they read.

These are python 3.5 notebooks with tensorflow 1.2.

By starting ``jupyter notebook index.ipynb`` you can navigate through the notebooks
